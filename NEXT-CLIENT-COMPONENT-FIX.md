# Next.js Client Component Fixes

This document details the fixes applied to resolve the client component errors that were occurring in the application.

## Issues Fixed

1. **Error: Attempted to call useToast() from the server**
   - Added `"use client"` directive to the toaster.tsx component
   - Updated import paths to use the consolidated `/src` folder structure

2. **Error: Attempted to call useTheme() from the server**
   - Added `"use client"` directive to the sonner.tsx component
   - Fixed import paths as needed

## Files Modified

1. `src/components/ui/toaster.tsx`
   - Added `"use client"` directive at the top of the file
   - Updated imports to use `@/src/hooks/use-toast` and `@/src/components/ui/toast`

2. `src/components/ui/sonner.tsx`
   - Added `"use client"` directive at the top of the file

3. `src/hooks/use-toast.ts`
   - Updated imports to use `@/src/components/ui/toast`

## Why These Errors Occurred

In Next.js, by default, all components are server components. When you need to use React hooks or browser-specific APIs, you must explicitly mark the component as a client component by adding the `"use client"` directive at the top of the file.

The errors occurred because:
- `useToast()` hook was being called in a server component
- `useTheme()` hook was being called in a server component

## Best Practices

1. Always add `"use client"` directive when using:
   - React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, etc.)
   - Browser APIs (`window`, `document`, etc.)
   - Event handlers (`onClick`, `onChange`, etc.)

2. Keep server components as the default when possible for better performance

3. Make sure import paths are consistent and match your project structure

## Next Steps

After these fixes, the application should no longer show the client component errors. You should now be able to:

1. Test the authentication flow
2. Verify that the dashboard appears after authentication
3. Ensure all components render correctly with the updated import paths
