# Map Implementation with Leaflet

This document outlines the changes made to implement a Leaflet-based map to replace Google Maps.

## Changes Made

1. Created new components:
   - Updated `components/map/SafeMapContainer.tsx` to use Leaflet
   - Created `components/map/LeafletMapComponent.tsx` to render the actual map
   - Updated `components/map/MapLegend.tsx` for consistency

2. Added required CSS for Leaflet in `app/globals.css`

3. Created an installation batch file `install-leaflet.bat` to help you install Leaflet dependencies

## Steps to Complete Implementation

1. Run the installation batch file to add Leaflet to your project:
   ```
   .\install-leaflet.bat
   ```

2. Restart your development server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

3. The map page should now display using Leaflet instead of Google Maps

## Benefits of Leaflet

- Open-source solution with no API key requirements
- Lower bandwidth usage
- Simpler licensing
- Excellent performance
- Large ecosystem of plugins

## Customization Options

The marker colors and styles can be customized in:
- `LeafletMapComponent.tsx` - Change marker icons and styling
- `app/globals.css` - Adjust CSS for Leaflet elements

You can add additional map layers beyond the default OpenStreetMap tiles by modifying the `LeafletMapComponent.tsx` file.
